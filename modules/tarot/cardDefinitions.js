const allSuitDescriptions = {
  "wands": ":stick::fire::sunrise: Associated with the element of *fire*, the suit of wands represents *passion, inspiration and willpower*. The wands imbue their users with primal energy, for it is through them that the cycle of creation can begin. Because of their ability to bring energy into any situation, they are also associated with action, ambition and making plans. At their worst, they can refer to situations that are filled with recklessness and lack of direction. As you follow the journey within the wands, you'll come across these themes again and again.",
  "cups": ":wine_glass::ocean::sweat_drops: The suit of cups rules over all that is associated with *emotions, the unconscious, creativity, and intuition*. They frequently talk about relationships, whether romantic or otherwise, and one's imagination and inner world. They are associated with the element of *water*, which becomes a frequent visual theme within this suit. At their worst, the cups suit is fret with uncontrolled feelings, fantasy, and a disconnect with one's inner voice.",
  "swords": ":dagger_knife::wind_blowing_face::tornado: The swords is the suit of *intelligence, logic, truth, ambition, conflict and communication*. It is associated with the element of *air*. In readings, these cards focus on the faculty and power of intellect, which like the swords themselves, are double-edged. This can be used for both good or evil, to help and to harm, and our greatest conflicts usually come from this delicate balance. At their worst, the swords can be abusive, harsh, and lack empathy.",
  "pentacles": ":coin::mountain::ore_catan: The pentacles is the suit of all things worldly and material. Though we will immediately think of the pentacles as relating to financial matters, we also can understand them as being associated with *security, stability, nature, health, and prosperity*. The pentacles are of *earth* element. When we see pentacles show up in a reading, they are usually concerned with your long term future, career, generosity, your household, business investments and your feelings of sensuality. The negative side of the pentacles show up as greed, jealousy, miserliness, and unbridled ambition at the cost of all else.",
  "majors": ":star: The Major Arcana is a 22 card set within the tarot that is considered to be the core and the foundation for the deck. All of the deck is filled with archetypal significance, but this is most pronounced within the Major Arcana. These cards follow a storyline that tells of the spiritual travels taken from the innocent wonder of The Fool to the oneness and fulfillment of The World. In other words, these cards *tell the story of humanity's spiritual evolution into enlightenment and individuation*. And so, as we follow the journey of the Fool, we can start seeing common parallels between our own stages in life and those in the cards, each card teaching a specific lesson and a concept to meditate over. Because they form the basis of the tarot, some readings can sometimes be conducted with only the Major Arcana as well."
